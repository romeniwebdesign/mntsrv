mntsrv is a web-based file sharing and management platform. It allows users to browse directories, search for files, and securely share files or folders with others through a modern web interface.

mntsrv consists of a Python backend and a React frontend. The backend handles directory scanning, file search, user authentication, and sharing logic, while the frontend provides an intuitive interface for browsing, searching, and managing shared files.

## Features

- Browse and navigate server-side directories from the web UI
- Search for files and folders with instant results
- Share files or folders with others using secure links
- Track sharing activity and manage access
- User authentication and access control

## Directory Structure

- `backend/` – Python backend for directory scanning, search, sharing, and API endpoints
- `frontend/` – React frontend for the user interface
