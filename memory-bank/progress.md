# Progress

## What Works
- Memory Bank documentation structure has been established and all core files are present.
- Project structure for backend (Python) and frontend (React) is in place.
- Docker and environment configuration files exist for containerized development.

## What's Left to Build
- Scaffold a root `.env.example` and `Makefile` at the project root for onboarding and CI/CD best practices.
- Review and update backend and frontend configuration for completeness.
- Implement and document feature development for file browsing, search, sharing, authentication, and progress tracking.
- Establish automated testing and deployment workflows.

## Current Status
- Project is in the onboarding and documentation phase.
- No major features have been implemented or documented yet beyond initial scaffolding.

## Known Issues
- Root `.env.example` and `Makefile` are not yet present.
- Further review needed to ensure all configuration and environment files are up to date.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Adopted a Memory Bank-driven documentation approach to support memory reset workflows.
- Prioritized clear separation of backend and frontend, with Docker-based deployment.
- Committed to regular updates of documentation and onboarding materials as the project evolves.
