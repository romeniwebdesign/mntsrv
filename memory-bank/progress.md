# Progress

## What Works
- **Memory Bank:** Complete documentation structure established and maintained
- **Project Structure:** Backend (Python/FastAPI) and frontend (React) fully operational
- **Authentication System:** JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **User Management:** Complete RBAC system with 4 user roles (admin, power, standard, readonly)
- **File Operations:** Browse, search, and sharing functionality operational
- **Admin Interface:** Full user management interface for administrators
- **Permission System:** Backend permission decorators and frontend conditional rendering
- **Docker Configuration:** Containerized development and deployment ready

## What's Left to Build
- **UI Permission Integration:** Hide share/delete/rename buttons based on user roles in FolderBrowser
- **File Operation Permissions:** Enforce delete/rename permissions in file operations
- **Root Configuration:** Scaffold `.env.example` and `Makefile` at project root
- **Testing:** Automated testing for user management and permission systems
- **Documentation:** Complete API documentation for new user management endpoints

## Current Status
- **User Management System:** Fully implemented and operational
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Backend and frontend integration complete
- **Sample Users:** Test users created for all role types (password: "secret" for all)
- **Admin Features:** User creation, editing, deletion, and role management available

## Known Issues
- Root `.env.example` and `Makefile` still need to be created
- FolderBrowser component needs permission-based UI updates
- File operation endpoints need permission enforcement

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Enhanced Security:** Moved from binary permissions to granular role-based access control
- **Admin Capabilities:** Added comprehensive user management for administrators
- **Permission Architecture:** Implemented decorator-based permission checking
- **UI Adaptation:** Frontend now adapts based on user roles and permissions
- **Sample Data:** Created test users to demonstrate different permission levels
