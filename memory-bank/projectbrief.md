# Project Brief

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based application designed to provide users with the ability to browse, search, and share files and folders through an intuitive interface. It consists of a Python backend and a React-based frontend, supporting secure user authentication and real-time progress tracking for file operations.

## Core Requirements and Goals
- Enable users to browse and navigate directories and files via a web interface.
- Provide robust search functionality for files and folders.
- Allow users to share files or folders with others securely.
- Support user authentication and access control.
- Display real-time progress for file operations (e.g., saving, scanning).
- Ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience across devices.
- Maintain a clear separation between backend and frontend components.
- Facilitate easy deployment and configuration using Docker and environment files.

## Scope
The project covers the development of both backend and frontend components, integration between them, and deployment infrastructure. It does not include third-party cloud storage integration or advanced user management features beyond basic authentication and sharing.
