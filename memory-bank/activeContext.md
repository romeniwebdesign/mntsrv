# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Initializing the Memory Bank documentation for the project.
- Establishing foundational documentation to support future development and onboarding.
- Reviewing project structure and ensuring all required context files are present.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` in the memory-bank.
- Documented project goals, product context, system architecture, and technical setup.

## Next Steps
- Complete the Memory Bank by creating and maintaining `progress.md`.
- Scaffold a root `.env.example` and `Makefile` at the project root to support secure configuration and developer onboarding, as per best practices.
- Review backend and frontend configuration files for completeness and consistency.
- Begin documenting any new features, changes, or issues as development progresses.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Adhering to the Memory Bank structure as the single source of project context.
- Prioritizing clear, up-to-date documentation to support memory reset workflows.
- Ensuring all environment variables and configuration patterns are documented and followed.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Modular, decoupled architecture between backend and frontend.
- Use of Docker and environment files for deployment and configuration.
- Regular updates to documentation after significant changes.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- A well-maintained Memory Bank is critical for project continuity, especially in environments with frequent context resets.
- Early investment in documentation and onboarding materials reduces friction for new contributors and supports long-term maintainability.
