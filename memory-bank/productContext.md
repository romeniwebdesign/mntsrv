# Product Context

## Purpose
This project exists to simplify and streamline the process of browsing, searching, and sharing files and folders through a modern web interface. It addresses the need for a user-friendly, platform-independent solution for managing local or networked file systems without requiring direct access to the underlying operating system.

## Problems Solved
- Eliminates the complexity of command-line or OS-native file management for non-technical users.
- Provides a centralized, web-accessible platform for file operations, reducing the need for remote desktop or file transfer tools.
- Enables secure sharing of files and folders with granular access control.
- Offers real-time feedback and progress tracking for long-running file operations.

## How It Should Work
- Users log in via a secure authentication system.
- The frontend presents a clear, navigable view of available directories and files.
- Search functionality allows users to quickly locate files or folders by name or metadata.
- Users can select files or folders to share, specifying recipients and permissions.
- The system provides visual feedback for actions such as scanning, saving, or sharing files.
- All operations are performed securely, respecting user permissions and privacy.

## User Experience Goals
- Intuitive navigation and minimal learning curve for new users.
- Responsive design for seamless use on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Clear error messages and guidance for resolving issues.
- Fast, real-time updates for file operations and search results.
- Consistent, modern visual design aligned with best practices in web usability.
